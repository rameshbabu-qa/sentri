/**
 * @module prompts/reviewerPrompt
 * @description Reviewer agent prompt — quality gate (AUTO-023 step 7).
 *
 * The Reviewer is the last LLM pass before tests reach the user. It checks
 * for issues the heuristic validator (`pipeline/testValidator.js`) can't
 * catch: brittle selectors that happen to be syntactically valid,
 * assertions that test the wrong thing, tests that race against the SUT's
 * load state.
 *
 * ### Output contract
 *
 *   { "decision": "approve" | "reject",
 *     "rationale": "<one sentence>",
 *     "issues": [{ "severity": "high" | "low",
 *                  "category": "<...>",
 *                  "message": "..." }] }
 *
 * - `decision: "approve"` → test ships to draft as usual. `issues[]` MAY
 *   contain low-severity advisory notes the operator can review later.
 * - `decision: "reject"` → test is marked rejected, surfaces in
 *   `pipelineStats.validationRejected`, and the existing feedback-loop
 *   path (`feedbackLoop.regenerateFailingTest`) picks it up for
 *   regeneration. `issues[]` MUST be non-empty when decision is "reject".
 *
 * ### Failure modes
 *
 * - Invalid JSON → orchestrator falls back to the heuristic validator's
 *   decision (test passes through unchanged).
 * - LLM rate-limited or breaker-tripped → same fallback.
 * - Per-run cost cap exceeded → same fallback for remaining tests.
 *
 * Cost shape mirrors Oracle: ~$0.005/test, $0.15 for a 30-test run, well
 * under the $1.00 default `reviewerMaxCostUsdPerRun` cap from migration 058.

Review this test and decide: approve or reject?

\`\`\`
Test name: ${test?.name || "unnamed"}
Intent: ${test?.intent || "(no intent recorded)"}
URL: ${classifiedPage?.url || test?.sourceUrl || "(no URL)"}

Code:
${test?.playwrightCode || "(no code)"}
\`\`\`

### Approve when
- Selectors are stable (data-testid, role-based locators, accessible names)
- Wait conditions are present where the test acts on dynamic content
- Assertions verify meaningful outcomes (cart count, form submission success, navigation completion)
- Test name clearly describes what's being tested
- The test, if it passes, gives real evidence the feature works

### Reject when
- Selectors rely on volatile attributes (auto-generated CSS classes like \`.css-1a2b3c\`, deep XPath, text that's likely to change between releases)
- Test uses \`waitForTimeout\` instead of waiting for an element/state (race condition risk)
- Assertions don't actually verify the test's stated intent (false-positive risk — test passes even if the feature is broken)
- Test name is generic (\`"Test 1"\`, \`"Login test"\`) or doesn't match what the code does
- The user action chain doesn't actually exercise the intent (e.g. an "add to cart" test that never clicks the add-to-cart button)

### Output

Respond with valid JSON only — no prose around it.

\`\`\`json
{
  "decision": "approve" | "reject",
  "rationale": "<one sentence>",
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "high" | "low",
      "category": "brittle_selector" | "race_condition" | "weak_assertion" | "wrong_intent" | "other",
      "message": "<specific actionable description>"
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

### Rules
- If \`decision\` is \`"reject"\`, \`issues\` MUST be non-empty and contain at least one \`severity: "high"\` entry.
- If \`decision\` is \`"approve"\`, \`issues\` MAY be empty or contain only low-severity advisory notes.
- Be strict but fair — reject only when a real reviewer would. Stylistic preferences (formatting, naming style) are NEVER grounds for rejection.
- Each issue's \`message\` must be specific enough to act on (e.g. "selector \`.css-1a2b3c\` is auto-generated — use \`getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })\`"). Vague messages like "selector is bad" are not useful.
