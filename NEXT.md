## Bundling guidance

Flag adjacent items as bundling candidates in your PR description rather than expanding scope mid-flight. Good signals: items touch the same module, one validates the other end-to-end, or both are S/XS effort and skipping a handoff saves more than it costs in review surface. Bad signals: different phases, M+ effort expansion, or the candidate surfaces after CI is already green. When in doubt, comment on the PR and let the human decide — never silently expand beyond the Current PR checklist.

## ▶ Current PR — AUTO-022 — AI eval harness with golden-set regression
**Effort:** L | **Priority:** 🔴 Blocker | **Dependencies:** INF-007 ✅ (`metric_samples` infra) | **Source:** `ROADMAP.md` Phase 5 (AUTO-022)
Ship a deterministic AI eval harness so prompt / model / pipeline changes can't silently regress test-generation quality. 50-case golden-set fixture; `backend/src/eval/pipelineEval.js` scores selectors / actions / assertions via Levenshtein distance against the expected output; new CI job `eval.yml` path-filtered to `pipeline/`, `aiProvider.js`, and prompt template files; fails the build on >5% regression vs the last green main run; persists per-case eval scores as `metric_samples` rows so trend charts on the Dashboard surface drift without re-running CI.

**Problem:** Every prompt tweak today is a leap of faith — there's no measurement showing whether a model swap or a prompt change moved selector / action / assertion quality up or down. Regressions surface as customer-reported flake spikes weeks after the change ships. INF-007's `metric_samples` table already gives us a place to persist trend data per-run; what's missing is a deterministic harness that produces those samples on every PR touching the pipeline.
**Fix:**
1. New 50-case golden fixture under `backend/tests/fixtures/eval-goldens/` — frozen DOM snapshots + expected Playwright code (selectors / actions / assertions) curated from the existing E2E corpus, covering form fills, list clicks, modal flows, multi-page navigation, and assertion-heavy success paths.
2. New `backend/src/eval/pipelineEval.js` — runs each golden through the same pipeline used in production (`generateAllTests` → `runPostGenerationPipeline`), parses output into structured (selector, action, assertion) tuples, and scores against the expected tuples via Levenshtein distance with explicit per-dimension weight knobs.
3. New `.github/workflows/eval.yml` — path-filtered to `backend/src/pipeline/**`, `backend/src/aiProvider.js`, and prompt template files. Runs `node backend/scripts/run-eval.mjs`, compares aggregate score to the last green main run pulled from a checked-in `eval-baseline.json`, fails on >5% regression.
4. Persist per-case eval scores as `metric_samples` rows (`kind=eval_score`) so the Dashboard renders a trend chart per selector / action / assertion dimension without re-running CI.
5. New `Eval` panel on `Dashboard.jsx` — sparkline of aggregate score over the last 30 days, drill-down to per-case rows, view-diff link to compare current vs expected output.
**Files to change:**
- `backend/tests/fixtures/eval-goldens/` (new) — 50 frozen `{ snapshot, expected }` JSON files
- `backend/src/eval/pipelineEval.js` (new) — runner + Levenshtein scorer
- `backend/scripts/run-eval.mjs` (new) — CLI entrypoint used by CI
- `backend/tests/eval-pipeline.test.js` (new, registered in `run-tests.js`) — unit-test the scorer against synthetic fixtures
- `.github/workflows/eval.yml` (new) — path-filtered CI job
- `eval-baseline.json` (new) — checked-in baseline; updated by maintainers via a dedicated `chore(eval):` PR after a deliberate prompt / model change
- `backend/src/routes/dashboard.js` — surface `evalTrend` aggregation in the dashboard payload
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` — new `EvalPanel` with sparkline + drill-down
- `frontend/src/api.js` — `api.getEvalRunDetail(runId)` helper
- `docs/guide/eval-harness.md` (new) — operator guide: how to inspect a regression, how to update the baseline, how to add a new golden
- `docs/changelog.md` — `## [Unreleased]` § Added
**Acceptance criteria:**
- `node backend/scripts/run-eval.mjs` exits 0 on the current tree and produces a `metric_samples` row per golden case under `kind=eval_score`.
- Modifying a prompt file to deliberately lower selector quality on ≥3 cases makes `eval.yml` exit non-zero with a "regression vs baseline" message naming each affected case.
- Dashboard `EvalPanel` renders a 30-day sparkline + drill-down list when at least one eval-run row exists in `metric_samples`; gracefully renders an empty state otherwise.
- Aggregate score, per-dimension breakdowns, and per-case Levenshtein diffs are reproducible across runs given the same goldens + model — the scorer is pure.
### PR checklist (AUTO-022)
- [ ] PR title follows Conventional Commits (`feat(eval): AUTO-022 — AI eval harness with golden-set regression`)
- [ ] Branch is off `develop`, not `main`
- [ ] `cd backend && npm test` passes locally
- [ ] `cd frontend && npm run build && npm test` passes locally
- [ ] `node backend/scripts/run-eval.mjs` exits 0 on the current tree and writes one `metric_samples` row per golden under `kind=eval_score`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/eval.yml` runs on the PR with path filters matching pipeline + aiProvider + prompt template files; fails non-zero when a synthetic regression is introduced
- [ ] New backend route `GET /api/v1/dashboard` `evalTrend` block has a frontend consumer (`Dashboard.jsx` `EvalPanel`) per PROC-001
- [ ] `docs/guide/eval-harness.md` documents inspect-regression / update-baseline / add-golden workflows
- [ ] `docs/changelog.md` updated under `## [Unreleased]` § Added
- [ ] `eval-baseline.json` checked in with the current-tree baseline (auto-generated by the harness on first run)

## ⏭ Queue (next 3 PRs after current)
### 1 · INF-009 — Helm chart + K8s readiness/liveness + DR playbook
**Effort:** L | **Priority:** 🟡 High | **Dependencies:** INF-008 ✅ (Postgres-default), INF-007 ✅ (metrics endpoint for liveness) | **Source:** `ROADMAP.md` Phase 5 (INF-009)
`helm/sentri/` chart with separate `backend` + `worker` Deployments, Postgres StatefulSet, Redis Deployment, ingress/configmap/secret; `readinessProbe`/`livenessProbe` on `GET /api/v1/health`; nightly `pg_dump` to S3 + restore playbook with explicit RTO (<4h) / RPO (<24h) targets.
### 2 · MNT-001 — Vision-based locator healing
**Effort:** XL | **Priority:** 🟢 Differentiator | **Dependencies:** none | **Source:** `ROADMAP.md` Maintenance row (MNT-001)
Add a vision-based fallback to `selfHealing.js` so locator failures route through an LLM screenshot pass before the test is marked broken. Wraps the existing DOM-only heal path; gated behind a per-project `visionHealing` toggle so OCR / vision-model spend stays opt-in. Touches `selfHealing.js` + `executeTest.js` only.
### 3 · AUTO-009 — Browser code coverage mapping
**Effort:** L | **Priority:** 🟢 Differentiator | **Dependencies:** none | **Source:** `ROADMAP.md` Phase 4 (AUTO-009)
Collect V8/Istanbul JS coverage during Playwright runs, aggregate per-test deltas, and surface a coverage heatmap on the Dashboard alongside DIF-011's existing site graph. Touches `executeTest.js`, new `coverageAggregator.js`, `Dashboard.jsx` — zero overlap with AUTO-022's eval-harness surface.

## 🔀 Parallel opportunities

Items that do not overlap AUTO-022's changed files and can land in a separate PR while it is in flight. AUTO-022 touches `backend/src/eval/`, `backend/src/aiProvider.js`, `backend/src/pipeline/`, prompt template files, `Dashboard.jsx`, and `.github/workflows/eval.yml` — any PR touching the AI pipeline or Dashboard payload will conflict and should wait.
